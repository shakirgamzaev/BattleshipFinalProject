# BattleshipFinalProject
Battleship with server and 2 clients connected to a local host machine 
This was my second introductory computer programming class at the University of Miami. The final project for the class was a Battleship game with 
a server and 2 clients. I programmed a server and a client, as well as an Info scores class that updated files. Those files recored history of clients losses
and wins.
